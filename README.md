# Features
-   Allows comparing views, selections, multi-selections, and clipboard combinations.
-   Can compare working copy against the base or previous revision of a file in SVN, Git, and Mercurial (requires some
    setup and configuration).
-   Dynamic context menus for selecting left side and right side compare.  Dynamic menus show what file is on *left*
    side (think Beyond Compare context menus).
-   View diffs in a view buffer or output panel.
-   You can selectively hide version control menus or disable the command completely via the settings file.
-   Can open diffs in external diff programs if desired (requires some setup and configuration).
-   Show only internal diff options, only external options, or show both depending on your needs and preferences.
